This section will provide guidance on how to implement and use the TERN Ontology for ecological site-based survey data representation and exchange. The TERN ontology supports several concepts to represent site-based survey data including site, site visit. To map any site-based survey data to a standard, users needs to identify site and related information, site-visit information, identify whether the activity is related to observation or sampling and related feature of interest.


The Ecological Field Monitoring Protocols designed by TERN Ecosystem Surveillance and funded by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE) will be used as an implementation example.
