# Soil pit characterisation protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Soil pit characterisation protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8f00b7c6-34b4-4203-8dcc-4be47f21d7db) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/soil/soil-pit-characterization/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Soil pit characterisation module records data about the site for the following feature types:

- soil horizon
- soil specimen

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

If a depth of 1 m+ cannot be achieved after three attempts, record what 'digging was Stopped by' (Appendix N) and the 'R horizon depth' in metres.

When record soil colours, assess and record matrix Colour, including the Hue, Value and Chroma using the Munsell Soils Color Charts (Munsell Color 2009), and Moisture status using the codes in [Soils moisture statuses codes](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/a1e434a8-3fbb-4323-a0ae-0e31308eba8b). Moisten the soil if it is dry. Dry colours may also be recorded.
