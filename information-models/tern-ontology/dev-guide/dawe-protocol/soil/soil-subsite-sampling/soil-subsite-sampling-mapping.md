# Soil Sub-site Samples protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Soil sub-site samples protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/e3ad3e5b-7c1c-4b59-bdb1-297f707d2ca3) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/soil/soil-subsite-sampling/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Soil sub-site samples module records data about the site for the following feature types:

- soil horizon
- soil specimen

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

If a depth of 30 cm cannot be achieved after three attempts, record what digging was Stopped by and sample down to the depth achieved.

Record if the horizon is ‘Typical’ or ‘Atypical’ of the 1 m+ soil pit observations. If it is atypical, record Atypicality comments.
