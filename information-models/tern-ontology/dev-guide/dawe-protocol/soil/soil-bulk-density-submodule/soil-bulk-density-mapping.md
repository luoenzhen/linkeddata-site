# Soil Bulk Density mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Soil bulk density protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d9e6739a-c2dd-4619-be43-1251449a6436) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/soil/soil-bulk-density-submodule/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Soil bulk density module records data about the site for the following feature types:

- soil specimen

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

Collection of soil core samples at 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm increments from the edge of the soil pit, sealing the core samples or storing them in zip lock bags, and post-field survey processing of soil core samples. Soil bulk density measures are collected so important soil parameters can be quantified, particularly carbon content.
