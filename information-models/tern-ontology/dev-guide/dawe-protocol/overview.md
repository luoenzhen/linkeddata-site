# Protocol Overview

:::info
This section is in draft. The content and structure of the document may change until it is released.
:::

The Ecological Field Monitoring Protocols consist of several modules to monitor different aspects of ecological sites. TERN is working with the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) to co-design and develop monitoring protocols to standardise data collection, representation and exchange. As part of the standardisation process, all protocols described in each module are defined and standardised as controlled vocabularies. In addition, each attribute and observable property are described as controlled vocabularies in a Resource Description Framework (RDF) model.   

The controlled vocabularies source code related to the modules are located on GitHub at <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/ternaustralia/dawe-rlp-vocabs">ternaustralia/dawe-rlp-vocabs</ExternalLink>.
