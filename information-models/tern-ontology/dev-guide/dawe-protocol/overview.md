:::info
This section is in draft. The content and structure of the document may change until it is released.
:::

The Ecological Field Monitoring Protocols consist of several modules to monitor different aspect of ecological sites. The protocols are developed by TERN as part of the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) funded project titled "Standardising environmental monitoring and data systems for improve decision making".

The documents here illustrate the way the protocols are modelled and implemented in an RDF system using the TERN Ontology.

The controlled vocabularies source code related to the modules are located on GitHub at <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/ternaustralia/dawe-rlp-vocabs">ternaustralia/dawe-rlp-vocabs</ExternalLink>.
