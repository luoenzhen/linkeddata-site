# Recruitment module - Age class protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Recruitment module - Age class protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c93922b2-3b0e-4ee1-b1ef-c9719d039f5f) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [recruitment-age/overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/recruitment/recruitment-age/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Recruitment module - Age class protocol records data about the site for the following feature types:

- plant individual
- plant population

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

This protocol consists of 3 sub-protocols to undertake (1) growth stage and life-stage surveys at the plot level, (2) seedling and sapling counts within belt transects and (3) small trees surveys within belt transects.

### Diagram

The following diagram shows the Recruitment module - Age class protocol mapping. Blue nodes are things related to the plant individual feature type. Green nodes are things related to the plant population feature type. Purple nodes are things related to both plant individual and plant population.
