# Recruitment module - Survivorship protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Recruitment module - Survivorship protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f470e27d-20ed-46dc-b64a-d67b39a9dffc) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [recruitment-survivorship/overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/recruitment/recruitment-survivorship/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Recruitment module - Survivorship protocol records data about the site for the following feature types:

- plant individual

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

This protocol allows users to tag individual plants with a unique ID, record location, health and life-stage, and record size measurements for individual plants.

### Diagram

The following diagram shows the Recruitment module - Survivorship protocol mapping. The orange node `plant missing status` is only recorded when revisit.
