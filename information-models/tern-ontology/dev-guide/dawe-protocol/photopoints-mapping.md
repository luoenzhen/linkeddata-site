# Photopoints protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Photopoints](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/05669173-2fe7-4b70-ba67-2e09fbe87de9) protocol.

## Conceptual modelling

This module outlines the steps to take a series of photos of the plot to collect monitoring data. It requires identifying the plot centre, marking the plot centre with a star dropper, measuring an equilateral triangle around the centre post to identify the locations of the three photopoints, and taking a series of photos to create a 360&deg; panorama.

### Diagram

The following diagram is showing photopoints. Rectangles coloured in blue show the sampling process of establishing three photopoints positions. Rectangles coloured green show the sampling process of taking various photos in each position to make a 360&deg; panorama.
