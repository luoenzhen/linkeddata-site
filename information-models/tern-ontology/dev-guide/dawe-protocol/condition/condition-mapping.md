# Condition Point Intercept protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Condition point intercept protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/bfcca277-85a8-476a-aeb1-315775bcd5f6) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [point-intercept/overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/condition/point-intercept/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Condition point intercept module records data about the site for the following feature types:

- plant occurrence
- plant litter

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

The Condition module involves the collection of quantitative, accurate and repeatable measures of condition attributes within the plot, using a combination of point-intercept, transect, belt-transect and plot-based methods. The primary aim of the Condition module is to collect baseline and revisit data for Regional Land Partnerships (RLP) projects, so any changes in condition following interventions can be evaluated.

Condition point-intercept is used to collect the condition point-intercept measures using four point-intercept transects, aligned with a subset of the existing plot layout described in the Cover module.

### Diagram

The following diagram show the Condition point-intercept mapping. The orange nodes are things related to the plant occurrence feature type and the yellow nodes are things related to the plant litter feature type.
