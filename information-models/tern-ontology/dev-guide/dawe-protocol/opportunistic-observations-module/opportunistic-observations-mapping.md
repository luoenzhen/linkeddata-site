# Opportunistic Observations protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Opportunistic observations protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/6fd39a33-9c4f-469e-80a5-e76b5d5f04a6) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/opportunistic-observations-module/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Opportunistic Observations module records data about the site for the following feature types:

- habitat
- plant occurrence
- animal occurrence

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

Opportunistic observations are unplanned (no defined survey effort) and made while undertaking other activities, at any stage of a project. Observations often occur while travelling between plots and while undertaking other modules.

`voucher condition` is only recorded for fauna specimens.

### Diagram

The following diagram show the Opportunistic Observations protocol mapping. The blue nodes are related to 'habitat sampling' on site. Light green nodes are things related to 'animal occurrence' feature type and green nodes are 'fauna vouchering' sampling on 'animal occurrence'. Light purple nodes are things related to 'plant occurrence' feature type and purple nodes are 'plant vouchering' sampling on 'plant occurrence'. Yellow nodes are 'taking representative media' sampling on observations. Orange nodes are things related to both 'animal occurrence' and 'plant occurrence' feature types.
