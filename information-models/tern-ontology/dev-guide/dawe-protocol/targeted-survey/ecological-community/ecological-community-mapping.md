# Targeted survey - Ecological community protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Ecological community protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4da8c123-b886-4881-91b3-1ff6a9b30e3c) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [ecological-community/overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/targeted-survey/ecological-community/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Ecological community protocol records data about the site for the feature type:

- plant community

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

This protocol is to record survey effort and any observations of target ecological communities within the project area.
