# Plant Tissue Vouchering protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Plant tissue vouchering](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1f2ac884-2177-403a-a6c3-27e109b1fc95) protocol.

## Conceptual modelling

The Plant tissue vouchering module involves the collection, rapid drying and appropriate storage of representative plant tissue (i.e. leaf) samples from the vascular flora species within the plot.

Replicate samples can be collected, and the minimum distance between replicate samples will be recorded in meters. `replicate number` and `minimum distance between replicates` are attributes to be recorded during `tern:Sampling` 'plant tissue vouchering'.
