# Cover full and lite protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Cover](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [full-protocol/overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/cover-module/full-protocol/overview) and [lite-protocol/overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/cover-module/lite-protocol/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Cover module records data about the site for the following feature types:

- plant occurrence
- land surface

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

The Cover module involves the collection of quantitative, accurate and repeatable measures of vegetation and substrate cover within the plot, using the point-intercept method.

### Diagram

The following diagram show the Cover mapping. The orange nodes are things related to the plant occurrence feature type and the yellow nodes are things related to the land surface feature type.
