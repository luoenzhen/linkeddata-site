# Fauna Plot Layout and Photographs Samples

:::info
This section is still in draft and the conceptual modelling for this module may change from now until release.
:::

This protocol module has no sampling or observation activities. Instead, it is more a set of preparation instructions for related modules such as the [Photopoints](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/photopoints-module) module and [Plot Selection](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/plot-selection/plot-selection-mapping) module.
