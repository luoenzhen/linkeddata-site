This protocol module is mainly about how to voucher vertebrate fauna. A voucher specimen is represented with the [material sample](https://w3id.org/tern/ontologies/tern/MaterialSample) class and additional details pertaining to the specimen may be captured using [attributes](https://w3id.org/tern/ontologies/tern/Attribute).
