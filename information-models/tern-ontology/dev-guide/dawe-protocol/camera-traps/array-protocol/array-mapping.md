# Camera Traps - Array protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Array protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1a6953e4-a830-41f8-9cfd-11ead4dd6bc2) protocol.

## Conceptual modelling

The Array protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps in an array within the project area, including locating camera trap points in an evenly spaced grid or at regular intervals along a transect, and then micrositing the exact camera trap point locations within the grid or transect to optimise fauna detections, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap make, model and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point, target species if applicable, deployment period) in a standardised manner directly into the App.

### Diagram

The following diagram shows the Camera Traps - Array protocol mapping. Blue nodes are things related to camera traps deployment and redeployment. Purple node is only related to redeployment.
