# Camera Traps - Targeted protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Targeted protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/cb497bbc-75dc-450d-b020-5bc3c54d5586) protocol.

## Conceptual modelling

The Targeted protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for the deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps at features of interest within the project area, including identifying features of interest, micrositing the exact camera trap point locations to optimise fauna detections, installing bait stations, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap make, model and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point, target species if applicable, bait station details, deployment period) in a standardised manner directly into the App.

### Diagram

The following diagram shows the Camera Traps - Targeted protocol mapping. Blue nodes are things related to camera traps deployment and redeployment. Purple node is only related to redeployment.
