# Camera Traps - Fauna plot protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Fauna plot protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/a2afccd5-766e-44bc-98c1-f27aae26727f) protocol.

## Conceptual modelling

The Fauna plot protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for the standardised deployment and recovery or redeployment of camera traps in a fauna plot, including standards for camera make, model and settings, camera placement and orientation, site preparation, bait station installation, deployment period, and entering the data directly into the App.

### Diagram

The following diagram shows the Camera Traps - Fauna plot protocol mapping. Blue nodes are things related to camera traps deployment and redeployment. Purple node is only related to redeployment.
