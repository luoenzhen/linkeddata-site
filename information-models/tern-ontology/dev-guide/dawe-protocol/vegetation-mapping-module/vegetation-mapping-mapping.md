# Vegetation Mapping protocol mapping

The mapping of the source app data to the TERN Ontology on this page is applicable to the [Vegetation Mapping protocol](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/15361f98-7669-410e-9b04-e9be069c7508) protocol.

Mentions of observable properties should refer to [overview](/information-models/tern-ontology/dev-guide/dawe-protocol/vegetation-mapping-module/overview) for the feature type and value type information.

## Conceptual modelling

The Vegetation Mapping module records data about the site for the following feature types:

- land surface disturbance
- plant population
- vegetation disturbance
- land surface substrate
- plant community

These observations are recorded for each site during a site visit.

This module provides a standardised approach to vegetation classification, which can be used to inform downstream vegetation mapping, reporting and analysis.

### Diagram

The following diagram show the Vgetation Mapping protocol mapping. The blue nodes are things related to 'land surface disturbance' feature type. Light green nodes are things related to 'plant population' feature type and greens nodes are 'plant vouchering' sampling on 'plant population'. Orange nodes are things related to 'vegetation disturbance' feature type. Yellow nodes are things related to 'land surface substrate' feature type. Pink nodes are things related to 'plant community' feature type. Purple nodes are 'taking photos' sampling on any materials from site.
