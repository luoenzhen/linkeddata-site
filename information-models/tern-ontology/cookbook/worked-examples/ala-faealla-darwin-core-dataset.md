# ALA Faealla Darwin Core dataset

The Faealla dataset is a worked example provided by TERN to the BDR implementers as a demonstration of converting a Darwin Core dataset into an RDF dataset using concepts from the TERN Ontology.

The Faealla Darwin Core dataset provides a data CSV in a "wide" format with over 160 columns.

Source code for the converted RDF dataset is at [ALA Darwin Core worked examples](https://github.com/ternaustralia/bdr-faealla-worked-example).

The discussions on modelling the dataset can be found at [DwC sample data #53](https://github.com/ternaustralia/ontology_tern/discussions/53).
